## MySQL-Docker 

This project is a flask-app integrated with a MySQL database. This is for the implementation portion of CS:4400 Database Systems completed by Eric Trautsch in Spring 2023.

The project runs with docker-compose which hosts a local web-app at port 5000 which connects to the MySQL database. The database is initialized with sample data, and the web-portion is to provide simple views of the database and verify their connections.
